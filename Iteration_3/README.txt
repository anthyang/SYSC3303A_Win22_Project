File names were chosen to be as accurate as possible:
- The class representing elevators is called Elevator
- The class representing the floors is called Floor
- The class representing the scheduler is called Scheduler. 
- An abstract class called request is used to communicate service requests from the floors to the elevator and scheduler. 
- A building class simply runs all threads concurrently.
